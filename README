This is a simple little command-line tool to demonstrate simple
Rust and practice compiling something with rustc.

The license is MIT; see LICENSE.

To build it, check the code out somewhere and then do "cargo build"

To run it, you can use "cargo run".  To make the output interesting, you need
to add a string argument afterward, like:

cargo run Phantom Menace is the best Star Wars movie

If you want to run this more than once you can copy the compiled binary from
the target/debug directory into /usr/local/bin or $HOME/bin or wherever you
want to run it from.

If you want to build in release mode (there's honestly no real point for
something this tiny, but for a real program the optimizations can matter), you
can do "cargo build --release" and then copy the binary from target/release
instead of target/debug.
